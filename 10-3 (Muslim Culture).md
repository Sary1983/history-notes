**Four Social Classes:**

- Protected People | Christians, Jews, etc (3)
- Slaves | All were non-muslim and many were war prisoners. (4)
- They generally performed housework and fought for the military.
### **Women**
- The Qu’ran states that men manage women affairs and righteous women are obedient and that both men and women are equal. They had specific rights on the lines of family, marriage, and property. They had more economic rights than that of China, Europe and India. They were still expected to submit to men.
Responsibilities depended on the income of the husband. Poor families had women working with the husband and taking care of children. Richer families had the women simply managing the household and servants. 
As time passed, women became more isolated. 
- Knowledge was very important for muslims.
